I am currently a second-year PhD student at the [Department of Statistics and Operations Research](https://stor.unc.edu/), [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://unc.edu/). Since 2023, I’ve been working with [Prof. Quoc Tran-Dinh](https://quoctd.web.unc.edu/) on numerical optimization and related problems. Previously, I received my Engineer's degree in Mathematics and Informatics from the [School of Applied Mathematics and Informatics](https://sami.hust.edu.vn/), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/), Vietnam. During my undergraduate time, I worked with [Prof. Nguyen Thi Thu Thuy](https://sami.hust.edu.vn/hoc-tap/giang-vien/?name=thuyntt) on numerical methods for solving variational inequality problems, split feasibility problems, as well as their generalizations and applications.
