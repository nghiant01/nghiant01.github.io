## STOR 320: Introduction to Data Science (Spring 2024)
### _Undergraduate course, STOR, UNC-Chapel Hill_
This course is an application-driven introduction to data science. Statistical and computational tools are
valued throughout the modern workplace from Silicon Valley startups, to marine biology labs, to Wall
Street firms. These tools require technical skills such as programming and statistics. They also require
professional skills such as communication, teamwork, problem solving, and critical thinking. 
You will learn these tools and hone these skills through hands-on experience working with datasets
provided in class and downloaded from certain public websites. During the first part of the semester, we
will focus on R programming skills and data visualization. Later topics will include: exploratory data
analysis, web scraping, data wrangling, modeling, and effective communication of results.
