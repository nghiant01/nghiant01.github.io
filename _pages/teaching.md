## Lab Instructor
### STOR 320: Introduction to Data Science (Spring 2024)
_Undergraduate course, STOR, UNC-Chapel Hill, Class size: TBD_

This course is an application-driven introduction to data science. Statistical and computational tools are
valued throughout the modern workplace from Silicon Valley startups, to marine biology labs, to Wall
Street firms. These tools require technical skills such as programming and statistics. They also require
professional skills such as communication, teamwork, problem solving, and critical thinking. 
You will learn these tools and hone these skills through hands-on experience working with datasets
provided in class and downloaded from certain public websites. During the first part of the semester, we
will focus on R programming skills and data visualization. Later topics will include: exploratory data
analysis, web scraping, data wrangling, modeling, and effective communication of results.

## Teaching Assistant
### STOR 155: Introduction to Data Models and Inference (Summer 2023, Session 2)
_Undergraduate course, STOR, UNC-Chapel Hill, Class size: 26_

Data analysis; correlation and regression; sampling and experimental design; basic probability (random variables, expected values,
normal and binomial distributions); hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for means, proportions, and regression parameters; use of spreadsheet software.

### STOR 155: Introduction to Data Models and Inference (Summer 2023, Session 1)
_Undergraduate course, STOR, UNC-Chapel Hill, Class size: 15_

Data analysis; correlation and regression; sampling and experimental design; basic probability (random variables, expected values,
normal and binomial distributions); hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for means, proportions, and regression parameters; use of spreadsheet software.

### STOR 113: Decision Models for Business and Economics (Spring 2023)
_Undergraduate course, STOR, UNC-Chapel Hill, Class size: 101_

This course equips you with essential skills for solving quantitative problems in business and economics. We’ll begin by investigating some basic models which appear repeatedly in applied settings – linear models, quadratic models, and exponential models. Marginal analysis – the analysis of the rate of change of one quantity with respect to another – will be covered next. The course culminates in a module on optimization, the set of techniques for finding the minimum or the maximum of a variable quantity such as cost, revenue, or profit. Applications covered along the way include compound interest, market equilibrium, and price and income elasticity. Much of our time in and out of lecture will be devoted to reviewing relevant algebra concepts, and learning differential calculus – the mathematical language for analyzing rates of change.

### STOR 215: Foundation of Decision Science (Fall 2022)
_Undergraduate course, STOR, UNC-Chapel Hill, Class size: 70_

Introduction to basic concepts and techniques of discrete mathematics with applications to business and social and physical sciences. Topics include logic, sets, functions, combinatorics, discrete probability, graphs, and networks.
