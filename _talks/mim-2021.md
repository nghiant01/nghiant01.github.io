**Abstract:** In this talk, we introduce a new self-adaptive algorithm for solving the
multiple-set split variational inequality problem in Hilbert spaces. Our algorithm
uses dynamic step-sizes, chosen based on information of the previous step. In comparison with the work by Censor et al. (Numer. Algor., 59:301–323, 2012), the new
algorithm gives strong convergence results and does not require information about
the transformation operator’s norm. Some applications of our main results regarding
the solution of multiple-set split feasibility problem and the split feasibility problem
are presented and show that the iterative method converges strongly under weaker
assumptions than the ones used recently by Xu (Inverse Problems, 22:2021–2034,
2006) and by Buong (Numer. Algor., 76:783–798, 2017). Numerical experiments on
finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional spaces and an application to discrete optimal control problems are reported to demonstrate the advantages and efficiency
of the proposed algorithms over some existing results.
