**Abstract:** There are many iterative methods for solving the multiple-sets split feasibility
problem involving step sizes that depend on the norm of a bounded linear operator F. The
implementation of such algorithms is usually difficult to handle with because one haas to
compute the norm of the operator F. In this talk, we introduce a new iterative algorithm for
approximating a solution of a class of multiple-sets split feasibility problem without prior
knowledge of operator norms. Strong convergence of the iterative process is proved. Then,
we recapitulate the two methods for this class of problem which were given by Nguyen
Buong (Iterative algorithms for the multiple-sets split feasibility problem in Hilbert spaces,
Numer. Algor. 76 (2017), 783–798) and by Tran Viet Anh (A parallel method for variational
inequalities with the multiple-sets split feasibility problem constraints, J. Fixed Point Theory
Appl. 19 (2017), 2681–2696). A numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed iterative
algorithm and compare it with the methods of Buong and Anh.
