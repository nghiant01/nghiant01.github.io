**Abstract:** In this talk, we study the multiple-set split variational inequality problem
in Hilbert spaces. Before presenting the new algorithm, we talk about a way for the
implementation of hybrid projection method, in which we compute the projection of a
given point onto the intersection of a finite system of closed convex sets in some special
cases. Then, we propose a new algorithm combining the hybrid projection method
with the proximal point algorithm, and establish a strong convergence theorem for it.
Some applications of our main results regarding the solution of the split variational
inequality problem and the multiple-set split feasibility problem are presented and
show that the iterative method converges strongly under weaker assumptions than
the ones used recently by Anh (J. Fixed Point Theory Appl. 19:2681–2696, 2017),
Buong (Numer. Algorithms, 76:783–798, 2017) and Xu (Inverse Problems, 22:2021–
2034, 2006). Some numerical examples are also given to illustrate the convergence
analysis of the considered method.
