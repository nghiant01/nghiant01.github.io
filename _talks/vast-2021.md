**Abstract:** As a subfield of convex optimization, semidefinite programming (SDP) was the
most exciting development in mathematical programming in the 1990’s, thanks to its several
applications in control theory, robust optimization, combinatorial optimization and eigenvalue optimization. Along with linear programming and quadratic programming, SDP has
become one of the basic modeling and optimization tools, as more and more problems are
modeled as semidefinite programs. In this talk, we introduce some fundamental concepts of
SDP and related issues. To be more specific, we talk about semidefinite cone, semidefinite
programming and semidefinite representability of a convex set in the relationship with conic
quadratic representability. One application of SDP in the problem of stability number of a
graph with Lovasz’s approach is considered in the last section.
